# 📊 RetailPulse: Deep Learning for Inventory Optimization

RetailPulse is a predictive analytics system designed to optimize retail stock levels. It leverages a **Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** architecture to forecast daily sales trends, enabling data-driven inventory management.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Sales Forecasting**: Uses 30-day historical windows to predict next-day sales.
- **Inventory Intelligence**: Automatically classifies stock status (Optimal vs. Low Stock).
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time sales dashboard built with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (Bi-LSTM).
- **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit.

## 📈 Methodology
This project implements the same core logic as my current research at **Telkom University** on time-series forecasting. It features:
- **Bi-LSTM Layers**: Captures temporal patterns from both past and future contexts.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Prevents overfitting for robust industrial application.
- **MinMax Scaling**: Normalizes sales data for faster and stable convergence.
